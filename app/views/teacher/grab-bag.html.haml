    Customize your lesson! Below you will find printable PDF "cards" &#8212; single-sided sheets with the images and text used in the lesson. Create your own interactive lessons and overhead transparencies.

    Each "card" consists of an image on the left, with text on the right. Print and fold the letter-sized sheet in half (with the image and text on the outside) to reveal an unlabeled image of the solar system object on one side and the information about the object on the reverse side. This allows the information to be revealed in a controlled manner, similar to the method used in the online exploration.

    For example, a statement can be made about the object ("This is the largest object in the solar system"), and the student(s) can select the image that they think fits this statement. Students can then check the "back" of their image to reveal whether they chose the correct object. If preferred, the pages can be used unfolded to make comparisons among the solar system objects.

In addition to the Sun and planets, the model includes five dwarf planets and unnamed comets, spread across the entire planet. Comet plaques are located on all seven continents as far north as Barrow, Alaska and as far south as South Pole Station, Antarctica. The nearest star to the Sun, the Alpha Centauri System, is on Earth's Moon, represented by Little West Crater at the Apollo 11 landing site.<br/>http://www.peoriariverfrontmuseum.org/whats-happening-now/the-dome-planetarium/community-solar-system
