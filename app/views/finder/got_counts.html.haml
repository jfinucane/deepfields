      - if @return_to_text == 'bias'
        Has your selection method introduced bias by making certain members of the population more likely to be picked than others?
      - elsif @return_to_text == 'sample'
        Is your sample size large enough to adequately represent the populations of the HDF?
      - else  
        But how accurate are these percentages for the whole image?
