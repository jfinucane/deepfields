  %img{src: image_path('final/enter-deep/graphic-what-is-deep.jpg'), alt:"  The Universe Looks Different at Different Depths (ie. Distances)   Observations of the Hubble Deep Fields reveal galaxies that are billions of light-years away. These distant galaxies represent an earlier period in the history of the universe. When we look at this distant view, we see mostly irregularly shaped galaxies. Hubble’s closer views of the universe, within just millions of light-years of Earth, show us different galaxy shapes. When we look within this shorter span, we see mostly rounded elliptical galaxies."}

    A ‘deep’ survey detects faint objects, whether far or near.  For the HDFs, the telescope was aimed at spots in the sky with few nearby objects, so most of the faint objects in the Deep Fields are also far away &mdash; 2 to 10 billion&nbsp;

    Since the light travels so far and takes so long to reach us, we see the galaxies as they appeared 2 to 10 billion years ago in the early universe.
