  You're on a

  to record and describe the types of galaxies revealed in Hubble's two samples of the sky.

  there's no time to admire

  So, for each deep view, use
  .std_bold random sampling.
  That is randomly snap galaxy portraits until you've collected just enough to accurately reflect the types of galaxies in that whole Deep Field.
