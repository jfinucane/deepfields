          To find the smallest reasonable sample, look for the smallest size that keeps the natural variability of results about as low as could be obtained by sampling much more of the population.

          Here, the total number of galaxies in your HDF is slightly over 1,000.    But a sample of 40-50 adequately represents this population because it yields about as low a variability as a sample of almost 1,000.
