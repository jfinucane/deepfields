  %img{src: image_path('final/last_stop/graphic-universe-at-depths.jpg'), alt:"  The Universe Looks Different at Different Depths (ie. Distances)   Observations of the Hubble Deep Fields reveal galaxies that are billions of light-years away. These distant galaxies represent an earlier period in the history of the universe. When we look at this distant view, we see mostly irregularly shaped galaxies. Hubbleâ€™s closer views of the universe, within just millions of light-years of Earth, show us different galaxy shapes. When we look within this shorter span, we see mostly rounded elliptical galaxies."}
